# CSC42finalproj2

Developed a conceptual data model for Reliable Rentals, a car rental company, detailing information about the Outlets, Vehicles, Hire Agreements, etc.,
by identifiying relations and entity types, participation and cardinality constraints, and candidate and primary key attributes associated with those entities.

Also developed a logical data model to derive relations from the conceptual model, and validated the logical model through normalization to 3NF and against user
transactions. The logical model identifies key integrity constraints, such as primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, alternate constraints, and general constraints. 

The logical model as then translated into a logical data model for the Oracle Enterprise DBMS where it was manipulated using SQL queries with embedded SQL.
